# The EGC-Z datasets

This repository will make available the datasets used in the paper "Automatic Chronic Degenerative Diseases Identification Using Enteric Nervous System Images" (to be publised) to the scientific community.

This paper presents three novel datasets created by researchers of the Enteric Neural Plasticity Laboratory of the State University of Maring√°. Such datasets are composed of image samples obtained from the Enteric Nervous System (ENS) of rats, in which the Enteric Glial Cells (EGC) can be visualized through the immunostaining of the S100 protein. Each dataset represents an investigated disease, being them: arthritis rheumatoid (AIA), cancer (TW) and diabetes mellitus (D). 

## Details

Each dataset is represented by the diseases' name abbreviations (AIA, TW, and D) in this work. It is worth mentioning that in this scenario, the datasets can be also called "disease groups". The datasets are composed of two classes, one containing image samples extracted from sick animals (S) and other from control/healthy (C) ones. The exact quantity of image samples per dataset and per class, and the image samples' dimensions, can be seen in the following Table.

| Dataset | Sick (S) | Control/Healthy (C) | Image Dimension | Total |
| ---- | --- | ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| AIA  | 210 | 208 | 1024 x 768  | 418 |
| TW   | 192 | 224 | 1384 x 1036 | 416 |
| D    | 290 | 224 | 1384 x 1036 | 514 |
